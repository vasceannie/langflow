## Prerequisites {#b5f154a3a1d242c7bdf57acf0a552732}


* [Python 3.10 to 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/) installed
* [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/),Â [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), or [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/) installed
* Before installing Langflow, we recommend creating a virtual environment to isolate your Python dependencies with [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/environments), or [conda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/conda)

## Create the basic prompting flow


1. From the Langflow dashboard, clickÂ **New Flow**.


2. SelectÂ **Basic Prompting**.


3. TheÂ **Basic Prompting**Â flow is created.

This flow allows you to chat with theÂ **OpenAI**Â component through theÂ **Prompt**Â component.

4. To examine the flow's **Prompt**Â component, click on the **Template**Â field of the **Prompt** component.

```plain
Answer the user as if you were a pirate.

User: {user_input}

Answer:
```

TheÂ **Template**Â instructs the LLM to accept `{user_input}` andÂ `Answer the user as if you were a pirate.`.

5. To create an environment variable for theÂ **OpenAI**Â component, in theÂ **OpenAI API Key**Â field, click theÂ **Globe**Â button, and then clickÂ **Add New Variable**.

	1. In theÂ **Variable Name**Â field, enterÂ `openai_api_key`.
	2. In theÂ **Value**Â field, paste your OpenAI API Key (`sk-...`).
	3. ClickÂ **Save Variable**.


## Run the Basic Prompting flow {#ef0e8283bfb646f99bbb825462d8cbab}

1. To open the **Playground** pane, click **Playground**.
This is where you can interact with your AI.
2. Type a message and press Enter. The bot should respond in a markedly piratical manner!

## Modify the prompt for a different result {#dcea9df0cd51434db76717c78b1e9a94}

1. To modify your prompt results, in theÂ **Prompt**Â template, click theÂ **Template**Â field. TheÂ **Edit Prompt**Â window opens.
2. ChangeÂ `Answer the user as if you were a pirate`Â to a different character, perhapsÂ `Answer the user as if you were Hermione Granger.`
3. Run the workflow again. The response will be very different.

Well done! You've built your first prompt in Langflow. ðŸŽ‰


By dragging Langflow components to your workspace, you can create all sorts of interesting behaviors. Here are a couple of examples:

- [Memory Chatbot](/starter-projects-memory-chatbot)
- [Blog Writer](/starter-projects-blog-writer)
- [Document QA](/starter-projects-document-qa)
